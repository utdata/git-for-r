One trick you might have to do to get the Git GUI to work within R Studio:

Make a change and get everything ready to push to Github.

As you are doing so, make sure you use the `-u` flag to push:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Once you've done this, Quit and relaunch RStudio and your project and it should the Pull/Push buttons should work.
