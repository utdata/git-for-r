title: "Collaborating"

Here we need to talk about branches, pull requests, merge conflicts and those types of things.

Get it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:utdata/git-for-r.git
```

Branch:

but 

```bash
git checkout -b branchname
```

Move to a branch:

```bash
git checkout branchname
```

Then git cycle as normal.
