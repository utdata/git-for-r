    "text": "3 Introduction to Version control\nWhat is version control?\nVersion control is a system that helps you track and manage changes to files over time. It lets you save different versions of your work, go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake, and work with other people without overwriting each other’s changes.\nImagine you’re writing a paper. Every time you make a big edit, you save a new copy: paper_v1.docx, paper_v2.docx, paper_final.docx, etc.\nVersion control keeps track of these versions for you. Have you ever used the versions feature in Google docs when working on an article draft? Then you’ve interacted with version control.\nWhat is Git?\nTo keep track of versions of coding projects, programmers use a version control tool called Git. It runs on your computer and helps you:\nYou can think of Git like a very smart “save game” system for your projects. Unlike in Google docs, our versions aren’t automatically saved for us. We have to tell our computers when and how to save a new version.\nHow GitHub fits into this:\nGitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories (your project + its history) online.\nIt lets you:\nIf Git is your notebook where you track all your work, GitHub is like an online library where you can store a copy of your notebook — and invite others to read it or even help you write it.\nIn short:",

For now, just know that the name you set here will be visible in any work you send to Github. You do not have to use your real name.\nSetting your Git username\nRun the following command from your Terminal, replacing “Your Name” with the username you’d like to use (including the quotation marks):\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\nCheck to see if you successfully set your name by running:\ngit config user.name\nYou should see a Terminal response message with the username you entered. If you didn’t get the response expected, then try again. Remember, be careful about punctuation.\nOnce you have your username set properly, we’ll set your email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nRemember, the username you set here will be visible (read: public) in any future commits you push to GitHub. If you choose to use a nickname or alias instead of your real name, keep it professional enough that you wouldn’t mind a future employer or colleague seeing it if you needed to share your work.\n\n\nSetting your git email\nThe email you enter needs to match the one you used to setup your Github account.\nSet your user email by running the following command, replacing “your.email@example.com” with your Github email:\ngit config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYour git email should be the same as the one you use on GitHub so your commits will be linked correctly",

What you ignore will depend on the type of project and the coding languages you’re using, but all Github projects use a file called .gitignore to let Git know what to ignore.\nIn general, the following kinds of files shouldn’t be tracked in Github:\n\nSensitive files: Files containing passwords or private information\nBig files: Git isn’t built to keep track of large files.\n\nFor R and Quarto projects, this will include the following common files types:\n\nSession and history files: .Rhistory, .RData, .Rproj.user/\nKnitting files: .utf8.md, .knit.md\nOutput/render folders: *_files/ ,_site/, _book/\nEditor and IDE Config Files: .Rproj.user/\n\nDon’t worry if you don’t fully understand what all of these files are yet. The important thing here is to know is that there are things we should and should not upload to Git, and the way we keep the things we don’t want in git out is by using a .gitignore file.\n\n4.2.1 Exercise 2: Make a .gitignore\nLet’s make a .gitignore now using the command line. Type the following code into the Terminal to make your new file using the touch command:\ntouch .gitignore\nThen open .gitignore in the Files pane in RStudio. If you don’t see the .gitignore in your file pane, you may need to refresh by clicking the refresh icon at the top right of the file pane.\nOnce you have your blank .gitignore file open, add the following lines:\n*.html \n_site/ \n.Rproj.user/\nLet’s break down what each of these mean:\n\n*.html : Ignore all .html files (rendered outputs)\n_site/: Ignore the entire contents of the _site folder\n.Rproj.user/: Ignore the hidden RStudio files\n\nSave the file, then check your Git status again:\ngit status\nNow the .html file should be gone from the list of red files Git “sees” because we’ve told it to ignore these types of files. ✨\nBefore moving forward, let’s add a few more things to the .gitignore to cover all our bases.\nCopy and paste the following code into your .gitignore file.\n# R\n.Rhistory\n.RData\n.Rproj.user/\n\n# Quarto\n*.html\n*_files/\n*.utf8.md\n*.knit.md\n_site/\n_book/\n\n# System\n.DS_Store\nSave and close the file.",

You don’t need to be a “tech wizard.” You just need a little curiosity.\nA few important things before you get started:\nTime to enter the Matrix, Neo.\nThink of using the Terminal like dm’ing your computer.\nInstead of clicking buttons or opening folders with a mouse or trackpad, you type commands in the command line asking your computer to do these things for you. Your computer reads your message and replies by immediately doing what you ask.\nThe Terminal (on Mac) or Git Bash (on Windows) are programs that can run a shell, are just the names of the user interfaces where you will type these commands.\nThe Terminal might look a little old-school (and let’s be real: a bit scary 👻), but it’s still one of the most powerful tools you can learn. People who work in code, data, security, and tech use it all the time.\nHere’s just a few examples of what we can ask our computers to do using the Terminal:\nWe can do all of these things by typing just a few words.

Do not run this the command to update to zsh. Zsh is a similar language that Mac is transitioning to by default. However, we will use Bash for this guide to keep everyone on the same page, regardless of their operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you launch Terminal for the first time, you’ll see some text like this.\n\n\nLet’s breakdown a few things from the screenshot above:\n\nComputer name: the characters before the ~ are your computer name.\nCurrent directory: The ~ character is Terminal shorthand for your “base” directory on your computer. The value shown here will update as you move around to different folders on your computer.\nUser name: The part immediatetely after the ~ is your username.\nCommand prompt: Lastly we have the $. This is the “prompt” where you type commands.\n\nYou type your commands AFTER the $ and then hit Return/Enter on your keyboard to run or execute them. We’ll practice doing just that in the next section.\n\n1.4.1 Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal\nLet’s try your first real command: finding out where you are using the command pwd.\nIn the Terminal prompt (remember after the $), type the following command:\npwd\nThen press Enter to run the command.\nYou should see Terminal respond with something like this:\n/Users/yourname\nor this\nC:\\Users\\yourname\nDepending on your system, the path may look a little different — and that’s OK.\nSo what just happened?\n\npwd stands for “print working directory.”\nIt simply asks: Where am I right now in the computer’s folder system?\nYour computer provides the answer: your current folder — usually your “home” directory when you first open the Terminal.",

As you use the command line more, you’ll start to use more of these flags in your workflow to give you more control over what your commands do. For now, just know when you see something starting with a dash, it’s probably a flag to add a little extra to the primary command.\nOptional exercise:\nIf you want, try one out yourself now by using the -l flag along with the ls command.The flag tells the command line, “give me more information about each file in my directory”.\nRun the following command:\nls -l \nTerminal will respond with detailed information about each file and folder in your directory.
