        "We'll learn the basic git commands and experience what they do by creating a new R project with a Github repository. It will be just enough knowledge to get the job done.\n",

        "If after going through this book you want to learn more, there are plenty of resources [on google](https://www.google.com/search?q=understanding+git+version+control&oq=understanding+git+version+control) where you'll find a ton of [posts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control), [tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=git+tutorial) about Git and version control systems. \n",
        "\n",
        "At its most basic, Git allows you to save your work at intervals and it keeps a history of files on your computer when you choose to save them. Once you have something that works, you can \"commit\" it and leave a comment about what you've done. You can then go back to that exact point in time if you need to. This frees the developer to experiment and make changes that may NOT work, because you know you can always go back. It works for any kind of file you want to put under version control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Git allows for a \"distributed\" version control system, meaning that all the code can be stored on a central server (like on the Internet) so other people can work on the shared code. When they \"check out\" a repository (or repo), they get the entire code base. Contributors can then make changes and \"check in\" those changes for others to use.\n",

        "When we work in R, we typically create an R \"project\" that keeps together all our files for a specific project. When we start tracking that folder's contents using version control, we call it a repository. So in reference to R, our repo (as we call them) is really just our project folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to tracking a repo's history on our computer, we can also push our changes to a remote server, like Github. This allows us to share our work with others, and collaborate on projects. This remote version will have the same historical record of our file changes as our local version.\n",
