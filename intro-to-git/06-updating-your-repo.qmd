## Make a Small Change

Let’s open your Quarto file you made in Chapter 1 (e.g., `01-index.qmd`) and make a couple changes.

Replace the auto-generated text and code blocks in the file with the following

``` bash
---
title: "Intro to Git"
format: html
---

# Summary

Here is a summary of the `mtcars` dataset.
```

Under the summary header and description, add a code chunk with the following:

``` bash
summary(mtcars)
```

Save the file. Now check the status in your Terminal again by running:

``` bash
git status
```

You'll see something like as a Terminal response:

```         
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   01-index.qmd
```

**Let's break this down** :

The red text tells us that Git sees something was modified in your 01-index.qmd. It's under the `Changes not staged for commit:` section, which tells us that Git hasn’t *staged* it yet (so it won’t be saved in the next commit).

## Stage the Change

We want to tell Git, “Hey, save this file in the next snapshot.”

We'll do this by **adding** the modified file to the snapshot. We can do that by running:

``` bash
git add 01-index.qmd
```

Now, check the status again.

``` bash
git status
```

Now you'll see your file in green and following message:

```         
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  modified:   01-index.qmd`
```

🎉 Great! The change is now **staged**.

## Commit the Change

Now, we'll save the snapshot (in Git's memory). When we do so, we'll want to include a descriptive **commit message** noting what we changed.

Type something like the following and git enter

`git commit -m "Add summary of mtcars dataset"`

A few best practices for commit messages:

✅ Use present tense: `"Add summary of..."`, not `"Added..."`\
✅ Keep it short but descriptive\
✅ Think: “What changed in this version?”

🕵️‍♀️ Good commit messages make it easier for you and others to pick up where you left off. If something breaks during an update or you need to go back to a prior version, commit messages will help your retrace your steps.

## Push It to GitHub

Now, we'll send the snapshot from your computer to GitHub by running:

``` bash
git push
```

Now go to your repository on Github — you’ll see your commit listed under the **Commits** tab and your file under **Code**!

::: callout-note
You may be wondering why our push command is shorter than it was last time. In our last push, we needed to connect our remote main branch to the remote Github repository. Since we're already connected our Quarto project to Github and set our branch to main, we can just use the `git push` command now.
