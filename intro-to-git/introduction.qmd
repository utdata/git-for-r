Welcome to the **Intro to Git** guide! We hope this guide will be a resource for you to learn the basics of working with version control for the first time.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for students who know some R and want to learn Git and GitHub to manage and collaborate on R projects (especially Quarto ones). It assumes little-to-no hands-on terminal experience but will encourage building confidence over time by interacting with Github through the command line.

Students who are brand new to the Terminal may also find it helpful to go through the **Intro to Terminal** section of this book before working through this guide.

## Prerequisites

Before we move on to working with Git and Github, we need to make sure you have what you need to successfully complete the exercises in this guide. The guide assumes you already have the following installed on your computer:

1.  R
2.  RStudio
3.  Quarto

If you are missing any these, please go to the links listed and make sure to install before moving on to the next chapter!
