title: "Resources"
---

This book is a work in progress. I actually wanted to point to existing resources instead of writing a new one, but I found I wanted to be more opinionated with the workflow I want students to use.

That said, here are the resources I'm working from, which might also be useful to students.

- [Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryant is a great on working with Git/Github and RStudio.
- The first four chapters of my book [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/) were not written with RStudio in mind, but it is a beginner look at Terminal, Git and Github. Once understood, moving that knowledge into RStudio isn't too much of a stretch. 
- Another way to go about it is to start with [Github's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git). It's comprehensive, but it's a lot. There is way more than the basic minimum knowledge there.
