title: "Using a Terminal"

A short chapter to explain basic bash commands like ls, cd, mkdir, etc.

# Terminal

Terminal (Mac) and Git Bash (Windows) are programs that can run a **shell**, which is a text-based user interface where you type commands that your computer understands.

::: callout
People (including myself) will use the term **shell** and **terminal** interchangeably. This means when I say "type into your shell" or "in your terminal", I mean type at the prompt in your Terminal or Git Bash program. Later we'll use our Terminal from within Visual Studio Code.
:::

Developers use a shell to issue commands to their computer to do things, like to install programs, change what folder their are in, etc. Using a terminal program to use your computer can be confusing at first, but it will become second-nature as you progress through this class.

The shell programming language we will use for these text-based interactions is called **Bash**. Bash is a Unix-based program and most of the Internet runs on Unix (or Linux) computers.

**Windows** doesn't understand Bash at all without the help of another program. This is why we installed **Git and Git Bash** so we can all speak the same language.

**Macs** understand Bash natively, but some day they will change to a similar language called zsh. When you launch a shell on newer Macs you might get a message _The default interactive shell is now zsh. To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`._ **DON'T DO THIS! JUST IGNORE IT.** We will continue to use **Bash**. Later we will add a command to disable this message.

## Launch your terminal in RStudio

> I'll show you how in person


## The terminal prompt

Before I adjusted it, I would see this when I launched my terminal:

```
COMM-A54338:~ ccm346$
```

- The first part before the `~` is my computer name.
- The part after the `~` is is my username.
- Lastly we have the `$`. This is the "prompt" where you type commands. You type your commands AFTER the $ and then hit **Return** on your keyboard to execute them.

In this book you might see examples of a command that includes an output. That first line will have the `$` before the command so you know that it is a command, but DON'T TYPE IN THE $. For instance:

```
$ pwd
/Users/ccm346/icj/myproject
```

Means you type in just `pwd` and then hit return.

## Typing vs copy/paste

I encourage you to type commands into your terminal instead of copy and pasting them from the lessons. Build muscle _and_ mind memory. Typing a command wrong and then having to figure out why it broke will help you learn it and remember it. If you just copy and paste blindly, then you won't learn anything other than **command-c** and **command-v**.

::: callout
I use the terms "folder" and "directory" interchangeably here. They are the same thing.
:::

## Print working directory

One of the hardest things to get a handle on when first working in the terminal is to figure out where you are on your computer. It's important, because you can run commands on any file on your computer from where you are, but you gotta know where that is before you can do so. So, we'll use [pwd](https://man.cx/pwd), or "print working directory".

1. In your Terminal, type and execute:

```bash
pwd
```

When I do this on my machine, here is what the command and response look like:

```
$ pwd
/Users/ccm346
```

Because I'm using my work computer my user directory is called "ccm346". Yours might be your name or part of your name. This user directory is called your "home directory". All of _your_ computer files are stored inside your home directory.

When you launch a new terminal it starts you out inside this directory.

## List directory

Let's see what is inside our home directory.

1. Do this:

```bash
ls
```

This will list everything in the directory you are in. Mine looks like this:

```
$ ls
Applications		Library			google-cloud-sdk
Creative Cloud Files	Movies			miniforge3
Desktop			Music			thingy.html
Documents		Pictures
Downloads		Public
```

It listed the names of all the folders and files of the directory I'm in. This is similar to opening a folder browser on your computer and then opening your home folder and looking inside of it.

## Flags

But sometimes, I want to know more information about the files, like their modification date. To do this, we introduce something called **flags**, which add nuance or detail to a terminal command. They start with a dash, and you can pile them on, as I'll demonstrate.

1. First, try this:

```bash
ls -l
```

::: callout-important
That is "dash L", not a number 1. Watch the spaces, too.
:::

My output looks like this:

```
crit:~$ ls -l
total 0

```

Well, that's a lot of info, and much of it jibberish. Here is what each part of those lines means ...

- `drwxr-xr-x` and similar is the permission information for a that file or folder. We aren't going to get into it here, but [you can read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Notation_of_traditional_Unix_permissions) if you like.
- The next number is the number of files inside the folder, sort of. If this is a file, the number will be "1". If it is a folder, the number will always be at least "2". We'll come back to this.
- Next is the owner of the file or folder.
- Next is a permission level for the user when the file was created.
- Next is the file size in bytes.
- Next is the last modified date of the file or when a file was added to the folder.
- File or folder name.

### Hidden files

Let's add another flag to your command.

1. Do this:

```bash
ls -al
```

My list got a TON longer. I snipped out the middle part here:

```
crit:~$ ls -al

```

The `-a` flag means "all" files and folders, including hidden ones. All the files or folders at the top that start with a dot like `.Box_EngineServer` are on the computer but not visible normally. There can be a lot of hidden them ... I have 40+, far more than regular files and folders.

1. Let's list again with just the `-a` flag:

```bash
ls -a
```

Here is the top of my list:

```
crit:~$ ls -a
.
..
.Box_EngineServer
.Box_StreemToSync
.Box_SyncToStreem
.Box_UIServer
.CFUserTextEncoding
.DS_Store
```

### Dot directories

But let's consider the first two returns:

```
$ ls -a
.
..
```

These are two special designations in the Unix world. A single period `.` designates "this directory" and two periods `..` designates the "parent directory", i.e. the folder "above" this one. Every directory has these, so that's why the `ls -l` always shows two items inside a directory, even if it is "empty" of regular files or folders.

We can use these "dot" and "dot dot" designations to move around into different directories, and to manage files in our current directories. They become super important when we make "paths" between files in our programs and web pages.

Let's see this "dot" designation in action by opening our "current" folder in Finder. This command differs slightly depending on your OS.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### macOS {.unnumbered}

1. Do this command:

```bash
open .
```

#### Windows {.unnumbered}

1. Do this command:

```bash
start .
```

:::

Since you are inside your "home directory", this should open that folder in your Finder.

## iCloud and One Drive

A word about cloud services like iCloud and OneDrive. We are going set up a place to store our projects so they are NOT backedup to cloud services. We do this for a couple of reasons:

- Later projects in this class will include thousands of tiny files. The process of writing them back forth to the cloud service can affect computer performance.
- Our projects use these files in order to function, and when they get off-loaded to the cloud then our code has problems working.

Don't worry ... we'll back up your class work through Github.
:::

## Make directory

Next we are going to make a new empty folder to store all our class files using the [mkdir](https://man.cx/mkdir) command.

1. Do this:

```bash
mkdir icj
```

2. Then use `ls` again to see your new directory amongst the others.

Creating a directory like this is exactly the same as opening a desktop window on your Mac creating a new folder. Folders and directories are the same thing.

3. Cool, let's make another directory inside of `icj`.

```bash
mkdir icj/newdirectory
```

4. Now you can do an `ls` on the "icj" folder to see what is inside it.

```bash
ls icj
```

It should show you `newdirectory`. Something like this:

```
$ ls icj
newdirectory
```

A couple of things about this:

You have listed the contents of the `icj` directory without being inside of it. You can list the contents of any folder on your computer if you know the path to it. In fact, you can do any command on any file or folder on your computer if you know its _path_. The **path** is the folder structure between where you "are" in the terminal to where the new file/folder is.

If you name a directory with a **space** in it, you'll not get what you want unless you put quotes around it. Because of this, I avoid using spaces in files and folders and use `-` or `_` instead. I avoid capitalization, too, because our folders become url names and sometimes caps mess it up, especially on PCs.

## Change directory

It's time to move into different folders within our terminal. The [cd](https://man.cx/cd) command lets us **change directory**.

1. Now, let's go inside the `icj` folder:

```bash
cd icj
```

2. Let's see what is inside:

```bash
ls
```

That should show you a result with the `newdirectory` that we created earlier.

## Parent directories

Now let's get crazy. Let's list the files "above" where we are.
 
 1. Type and run this command.

```bash
$ ls ../
```

Remember I said that two dots means the parent directory? This should show you the list of files and folders in your home directory.

2. Now, confirm where you are:

```bash
pwd
```

Which should still be `icj`. So you had listed the files for the folder "above" you.

## Tab completion

If you are doing `ls` or `cd` or otherwise referencing a path in the terminal, you don't have to type the whole word for each directory. If you are trying to list the contents of "newdirectory", then start with `ls newd` and then hit tab, and it will finish out the path as `ls newdirectory`. This is SUPER handy and you should use it often. Like all the time.

::: callout-important
Tab completion makes your programming live so much easier, and it works in more places than in our terminal. Use this skill.
:::

## On the right path

### Relative paths

You can `ls` files or `cd` into any directory relative to your current working directory using `../` to move "up" the folder structure and then use the name of the new directory to move inside it. So a path like this: `ls ../../Users/Cory` is to travel up two folders, then into `Users` then into `Cory` and then list all the files there.

This is very powerful in programming, because you might be writing and testing code on your own computer, but then run the program on another computer, so if `file01.py` needs to talk to `file02.py`, you don't want to hard-code a path like `http://utdata.cmcdonald.com/scripts/file02.py`, because you might not always be on utdata.cmcdonald.com. If it's in the same folder, you could use `file02.py` or `./file02.py`.

### Root-relative paths

You can reference the "root" or the top level of whatever server or machine you are on even if you don't know the name of it, by starting your path with a slash like this: `/scripts/file01.py`. That's called a **root-relative** path. If you know the root-relative path to a file or folder, you can always find it no matter what directory you are currently in. We won't use this much in this class.

### Absolute paths

An absolute path includes the domain or computer name. If I reference `http://utdata.cmcdonald.com/scripts/file01.py` in my code or script, it will only work if I'm on `utdata.cmcdonald.com`. If I move that script to another computer or server, it will still try to pull from `utdata.cmcdonald.com` instead of the version on the new computer. We avoid using absolute paths in this class for this reason.

### The home directory shortcut

There is also a path shortcut called `~/` that stands for "the home directory of the logged in person". You might see that referenced in paths like `~/Documents/` but that would really take me to `/Users/ccm346/Documents/` on my computer. But what's cool is the same `~/Documents/` path works on YOUR computer, even though your user directory name is different.
