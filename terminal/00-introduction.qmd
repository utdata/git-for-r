**First things first:**

If you've never opened a Terminal window before, you‚Äôre not alone. This guide is here to show you that the command line isn‚Äôt something to fear. It‚Äôs just a different way to tell your computer what to do ‚Äî directly, and often much faster.

You don‚Äôt need to memorize anything right now. You don‚Äôt need to be a "tech wizard." You just need a little curiosity.

Time to enter the Matrix, Neo.

![Fun fact: the original design for the green "digital rain" animation used in the Matrix was based on scans of the creator's wife's Japanese cookbook.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Digital_rain_animation_medium_letters_shine.gif)

## What is the Terminal, Anyway?

Think of using the Terminal like dm'ing your computer.

Instead of clicking buttons or opening folders with a mouse or trackpad, you type **commands** asking your computer to do these things for you. Your computer reads your message and replies by immediately doing what you ask.

The **Terminal** (on Mac) or **Git Bash** (on Windows) are programs that can run a shell, are just the names of the user interfaces where you will type these commands.

## Terminology note

People (including the authors of this guide) will use the term **shell** and **terminal** interchangeably. This means when we say ‚Äútype into your shell‚Äù or ‚Äúin your terminal‚Äù, we mean type at the prompt in your Terminal or Git Bash program. Later, we‚Äôll use our Terminal from within Visual Studio Code.

Throughout this guide there will be several of these terminology notes to explain key terms ‚Äì especially those used interchangeably ‚Äì that may be confusing to new programmers. Knowing the language coders use frequently helps when reading documentation and when seeking help in online spaces like Stack Overflow.

The Terminal might look a little old-school (and let's be real: a bit scary üëª), but it‚Äôs still one of the most powerful tools you can learn. People who work in code, data, security, and tech use it all the time.

Here's just a few examples of what we can ask our computers to do using the Terminal:

-   List all the files in a folder

-   Create a new folder

-   Install programs

-   Move files around

-   Automate tasks

We can do all of these things by typing just a few words. But to communicate effectively with our Terminals, we have to learn "speak" its language. In this guide, you'll learn the basics of this language to get you started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Speaking the Terminal's language

The programming language we will use for our interactions in the Terminal is called **Bash**. Bash is a Unix-based program and most of the Internet runs on Unix (or Linux) computers.

Macs understand Bash natively, but Windows doesn‚Äôt understand Bash at all without the help of another program. This is why Git and Git Bash were downloaded in the prerequisites -- so we can all speak the same language, regardless of the machines we're using.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Open the Terminal

First things first, we need to actually *open* the Terminal on our machines.

Here‚Äôs how to find it on your computer:

-   **Mac**:\
    Press `Command + Space`, type **Terminal**, and hit `Enter`.

-   **Windows**:\
    Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Terminal** or **PowerShell**, and open it.\
    (There‚Äôs also something called "Command Prompt" ‚Äî close enough for now.)

-   **Linux**:\
    Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` ‚Äî it‚Äôs probably already installed!

**Tip:** If you want, you can change the Terminal‚Äôs color theme to make it more comfortable to look at. (We‚Äôll cover this later.)

## Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal

Ok, now that the Terminal is open on your computer, let's take a quick look at the text showing in the window when you launch to familiarize ourselves with basics of the interface.

::: callout-caution
## Note for newer Mac users

When you launch the Terminal for the first time, you'll probably see a prompt saying something like:

```         
The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
```

**DISREGARD THIS MESSAGE**. Do not run this the command to update to zsh. Zsh is a similar language that Mac is transitioning to by default. However, we will use Bash for this guide to keep everyone on the same page, regardless of their operating systems.

![When you launch Terminal for the first time, you'll see some text like this.](../images/terminal_launch%20copy.png)

**Let's breakdown a few things from the screenshot above:**

1.  Computer name: the characters before the `~` are your computer name.
2.  Current directory: The `~` character is Terminal shorthand for your "base" directory on your computer. The value shown here will update as you move around to different folders on your computer.
3.  User name: The part immediatetely after the `~` is your username.
4.  Command prompt: Lastly we have the `$`. This is the ‚Äúprompt‚Äù where you type commands.

You type your commands AFTER the `$` and then hit `Return`/`Enter` on your keyboard to run or **execute** them. We'll practice doing just that in the next section.

### Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal

Let‚Äôs try your first real command: finding out *where* you are using the command `pwd`.

In the Terminal prompt (remember after the `$)`, type the following command:

``` bash
pwd
```

Then press `Enter` to *run* the command.

You should see Terminal respond with something like this:

`/Users/yourname`

or this

`C:\Users\yourname`

Depending on your system, the path may look a little different ‚Äî and that's OK.

**So what just happened?**

-   `pwd` stands for "**print working directory**."

-   It simply asks: *Where am I right now in the computer‚Äôs folder system?*

-   Your computer provides the answer: your current folder ‚Äî usually your "home" directory when you first open the Terminal.

# ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You've made it to the end of chapter 1. Good job!

**You‚Äôve now:**

-   Opened the Terminal.

-   Typed and ran your first command.

-   Seen your computer respond back.

You're officially no longer a Terminal beginner. üôå

**A few quick Tips Before You Move On to the next chapter:**

1. **Command Case Matters in the Terminal**: `pwd` is *not* the same as `PWD`.
1. **Press Enter**: Every command you type needs an `Enter` to run.
1.  **You can‚Äôt break things easily**: Typing `pwd` won't hurt your computer.\
    (In fact, almost everything we‚Äôll do in this guide will be safe.)

Next up, we‚Äôll learn how to *move around* inside your computer using simple commands. Whenever you're ready, proceed to the next chapter: \[\[Terminal Chapter 2\]\]
