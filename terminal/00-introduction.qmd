# Welcome to the Terminal

**First things first:**  

If you've never opened a Terminal window before, youâ€™re not alone â€” and you're in the right place. This guide is here to show you that the command line isnâ€™t something to fear. Itâ€™s just a different way to tell your computer what to do â€” directly, and often much faster.

You donâ€™t need to memorize anything right now. You donâ€™t need to be a "tech wizard." You just need a little curiosity.

Let's get started!

Time to enter the Matrix, Neo.

## **What is the Terminal, Anyway?**

Think of the Terminal as _text messaging your computer_.

Instead of clicking buttons or opening folders with a mouse or trackpad, you type **commands**. Your computer reads your text and immediately does what you ask.

For example:

- You can ask the computer to list all the files in a folder.
    
- You can ask it to create a new folder.
    
- You can even install programs, move files around, or automate tasks â€” all by typing a few words.
    

The Terminal might look a little old-school, but itâ€™s still one of the most powerful tools you can learn.  
(And yes â€” people who work with code, data, security, and tech use it all the time.)

## **How to Open the Terminal**

Hereâ€™s how to find it on your computer:

- **Mac**:  
    Press `Command + Space`, type **Terminal**, and hit `Enter`.
    
- **Windows**:  
    Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Terminal** or **PowerShell**, and open it.  
    (Thereâ€™s also something called "Command Prompt" â€” close enough for now.)
    
- **Linux**:  
    Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` â€” itâ€™s probably already installed!
    

**Tip:** If you want, you can change the Terminalâ€™s color theme to make it more comfortable to look at. (Weâ€™ll cover this later.)

## **Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal**

Letâ€™s try your first real command: finding out _where_ you are.

In the Terminal window, type:

```pwd``` 

(Then press `Enter`.)

You should see something like:

`/Users/yourname`

or

`C:\Users\yourname`

Depending on your system, the path may look a little different â€” and that's OK.

**What just happened?**

- `pwd` stands for "**print working directory**."
    
- It simply asks: _Where am I right now in the computerâ€™s folder system?_
    
- The answer is your current folder â€” usually your "home" area when you first open the Terminal.

## **Quick Tips Before You Move On**

- **Command Case Matters**: `pwd` is _not_ the same as `PWD`.
    
- **Press Enter**: Every command you type needs an `Enter` to run.
    
- **You Canâ€™t Break It Easily**: Typing `pwd` won't hurt your computer.  
    (In fact, almost everything weâ€™ll do today is safe.)
