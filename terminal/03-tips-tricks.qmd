title: "Command line tips and tricks"
---

In this brief chapter, we'll touch on a few things that should help you work quicker in the Terminal. We'll also touch on navigating common issues you'll probably run into.

## **Command History**

The command line keeps a history of the commands you give it. Much like scrolling back up through the messages in a conversation on your phone, you can "scroll up" through the conversation you've had with the Terminal (only withe Terminal, you'll only see the messages *you* sent).

**How to view your command history:**

To see prior commands you've written, just press the **up arrow** `â†‘` on your keyboard. Each press will take you to the prior command in your history.

To get back to an empty prompt, scroll back down using the **down arrow** `â†“`

You can re-run any command that pops up simply by hitting the `Enter` / `return` key on your keyboard. No need to re-type things!

**Why this is useful**

In programming, we often repeat commands quite frequently (think about how often you re-run your notebook code in R-Studio, for example).

Having a command history is helpful because it:

-   **Saves time** â€“ You can quickly repeat or modify previous commands with the â†‘ key instead of retyping them.

-   **Reduces mistakes** â€“ Reusing known-good commands lowers the chance of typos or syntax errors.

-   **Aids learning** â€“ You can review what you've done, which helps you remember your steps and can help with troubleshooting if something goes wrong.

## **Canceling a Command**

One of the scariest things for new Terminal users happens when you run something you didn't mean to.

If you realize you made a mistake while a command is **running**, press:

`Ctrl + C`

This **cancels** the running command and brings you back to the prompt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Tab Completion**

You read about this in Chapter 2, but it's worth mentioning again because it's that good.

Remember: start typing a folder or file name, press `Tab`, and Terminal finishes it for you if possible.\
Saves time and typos!

If there's more than one similarly-named files in your folder, you may have to type more characters to get to the one you want.

# **Chapter 5: Common Pitfalls and How to Recover**

-   **Command not found?**\
    You might have a typo or the program isnâ€™t installed.

-   **Permission denied?**\
    You might need to add `sudo` before your command (but **be careful** â€” `sudo` gives superpowers that can break things).

-   **Stuck in a weird app inside Terminal?**\
    Try pressing `Ctrl + C` or `Ctrl + D` to exit.

# ðŸŽ‰ **Final Words**

Youâ€™ve now learned:

-   How to open the Terminal

-   How to move around

-   How to create and manage files and folders

-   How to read and use simple flags

-   How to fix common mistakes

Youâ€™ve built a *real foundation* for anything else youâ€™ll learn later â€” whether thatâ€™s coding, scripting, data science, cybersecurity, or just being more powerful with your own computer.

**The Terminal is your friend.**\
Keep practicing â€” the more you use it, the more natural it will feel.

Good job! ðŸš€
