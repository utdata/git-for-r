|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `command not found`            | You typed a command the shell doesn't recognize                 | Check for typos or whether the tool is installed          |
| `No such file or directory`    | You're trying to access a file/path that doesn't exist          | Use `ls` to explore and make sure the path is correct     |
| `Permission denied`            | You tried to do something you don‚Äôt have permission for         | Use `sudo` (if appropriate), or check file permissions    |
| `Is a directory`               | You tried to treat a directory like a file                      | Double-check what kind of thing you're trying to use      |
