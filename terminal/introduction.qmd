**First things first:**

If you've never opened a Terminal window before, you’re not alone. This guide is here to show you that the command line isn’t something to fear. It’s just a different way to tell your computer what to do — directly, and often much faster.

You don’t need to memorize anything right now. You don’t need to be a "tech wizard." You just need a little curiosity.

**A few important things before you get started:**

1.  **Type your commands:** Getting used to writing in the command line is key to learning and remembering common commands. Though many of the code blocks in this books allow you to copy the code inside, please try to type it yourself (at least on the first try). You can always copy if you run into errors.
2.  **Mini exercises:** There will be small exercises throughout this guide to reinforce learning and get you more comfortable working in the Terminal. Learning to code is largely done through *doing*, so we highly recommend you take the time to do them.
3.  **Terminology notes:** Throughout this guide, there will be several callout boxes titled "terminology notes". These callouts will be used to explain key terms – especially those used interchangeably – that may be confusing to new programmers. We recommend you take the time to read them because knowing the language coders use will help when reading documentation and when seeking help in online spaces like Stack Overflow.

Time to enter the Matrix, Neo.

## What is the Terminal, Anyway?

Think of using the terminal like dm'ing your computer.

Instead of clicking buttons or opening folders with a mouse or trackpad, you type **commands** in the **command line** asking your computer to do these things for you. Your computer reads your message and replies by immediately doing what you ask.

The **Terminal** (on Mac) or **Git Bash** (on Windows) are the names of the programs that can run a shell. They are just the text-based **user interfaces** where you will type these commands.

## Terminology note

People (including the authors of this guide) will use the term **shell**, **terminal** and **command line** interchangeably. This means when we say “type into your shell”, "in your command line", or “in your terminal”, we mean type at the prompt in your Terminal or Git Bash program. Later, we’ll use our Terminal from within Visual Studio Code.

In reality, there are some nuances:

1.  The **terminal** opens a window.
2.  Inside that, a **shell** runs.
3.  You interact with it through the **command line** interface.

In practical terms, just know they usually mean the same thing out in the wild.
:::

The terminal might look a little old-school (and let's be real: a bit scary 👻), but it’s one of the most powerful tools you can learn. People who work in code, data, security, and tech use it all the time.

Here's just a few examples of what we can ask our computers to do using the terminal:

-   List all the files in a folder

-   Create a new folder

-   Install programs

-   Move files around

-   Automate tasks

We can do all of these things by typing just a few words. But to communicate effectively with our terminals, we have to learn "speak" its language. In this guide, you'll learn the basics of this language to get you started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Speaking the terminal's language

The programming language we will use for our interactions in the terminal is called **Bash**. Bash is a Unix-based program and most of the Internet runs on Unix (or Linux) computers.

Macs understand Bash natively, but Windows doesn’t understand Bash at all without the help of another program. This is why Git and Git Bash were downloaded in the prerequisites -- so we can all speak the same language, regardless of the machines we're using.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Open the Terminal

First things first, we need to actually *open* the Terminal on our machines.

Here’s how to find it on your computer:

-   **Mac**:\
    Press `Command + Space`, type **Terminal**, and hit `Enter`.

-   **Windows**:\
    Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Terminal** or **PowerShell**, and open it.\
    (There’s also something called "Command Prompt" — close enough for now.)

-   **Linux**:\
    Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` — it’s probably already installed!

**Tip:** If you want, you can change the Terminal’s color theme to make it more comfortable to look at. (We’ll cover this later.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal

Ok, now that the terminal windown is open on your computer, let's take a quick look at the text showing in the window when you launch to familiarize ourselves with basics of the interface.

::: callout-caution
## Note for newer Mac users

When you launch the Terminal for the first time, you'll probably see a prompt saying something like:

```         
The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
```

**DISREGARD THIS MESSAGE**. Do not run this the command to update to zsh. Zsh is a similar language that Mac is transitioning to by default. However, we will use Bash for this guide to keep everyone on the same page, regardless of their operating systems.

![When you launch Terminal for the first time, you'll see some text like this.](../images/terminal_launch%20copy.png)

**Let's breakdown a few things from the screenshot above:**

1.  **Computer name:** the characters before the `~` is your computer's name (you may not have known it even had one).
2.  **Current directory:** The `~` character is Terminal shorthand for your "base" directory on your computer. The value shown here will update as you move around to different folders on your computer.
3.  **User name:** The part immediatetely after the `~` is your username.
4.  **Command prompt:** Lastly we have the `$`. This is the “prompt” where you type commands.

You type your commands AFTER the `$` and then hit `Return`/`Enter` on your keyboard to run or **execute** them. We'll practice doing just that in the next section.

### Your First Command: Saying Hello to the Terminal

Let’s try your first real command: finding out *where* you are using the command `pwd`.

1. In the terminal prompt (remember, after the `$)`, type the following command:

``` bash
pwd
```

2. Press `Enter` to *run* the command.

You should see Terminal respond with something like this:

`/Users/yourname`

or this

`C:\Users\yourname`

Depending on your system, the path may look a little different — and that's OK.

**So what just happened?**

-   `pwd` stands for *"print working directory."*

-   It simply asks: *Where am I right now in the computer’s folder system?*

-   Your computer provides the following answer: your current folder — usually your "home" directory when you first open the Terminal.

## 🎯 Checkpoint

You've made it to the end of chapter 1. Good job!

**You’ve now:**

-   Opened the Terminal.

-   Typed and run your first command.

-   Seen your computer respond back.

You're officially no longer a terminal beginner. 🙌

**A few quick Tips Before You Move On to the next chapter:**

-  **Command Case Matters in the Terminal**: `pwd` is *not* the same as `PWD`.
-  **Press Enter to run things**: Every command you type needs an `Enter` to run.
- **You can’t break things easily**: Typing `pwd` won't hurt your computer.\
    (In fact, almost everything we’ll do in this guide will be safe)

We’ll learn how to **move around** inside your computer using simple commands. Whenever you're ready, proceed to the next chapter.
