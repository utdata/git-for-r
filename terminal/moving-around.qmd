title: "Moving around in the terminal"
---

Now that you know where you *are* (`pwd`), it's time to explore what's *around* you. Specifically, we'll start by moving between different folders on your computer.

::: callout-note
## Terminology note

In the programming world, folders are usually called **directories**. You‚Äôll hear both words out in the world ‚Äî they mean the same thing.
:::

## What‚Äôs in this folder? (`ls`)

> `ls` stands for **list**.

If you want to *see* what's inside the current directory, you use the `ls` command.

As we said in Chapter 1, the terminal lets you interact with files the same way you would with **File Explorer** on Windows and **Finder** on a Mac ‚Äî except you'll be using text instead of clicking.

When your first launch terminal, you'll see a `~` (called a tilde), which lets you know you're in your *base* or home directory. We want to ask the terminal to tell us what is inside this home directory.

To ask terminal what's inside a directory:

1.  Type the following in your terminal:

``` bash
ls
```

2.  press `Enter` to run the command.

Terminal will *respond* to your command with a list of files and folders like this:

```         
_projects Desktop       Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public 
```

Your list may be different depending on what's in your computer's home folder. That's ok!

In any case, the list of directories returned by Terminal will match the folders you would see if you clicked on your home directory in the Finder on a Mac or in File Explorer on a Windows machine. For example, the list of folders listed in the example response above matches what we see in our home directory using Finder below.

Quick Recap on the `ls` command:

-   `ls` is short for "**list**."

-   It literally asks terminal, "list what‚Äôs here."

## Moving around (`cd`)

> `cd` stands for **change directory**.

Seeing what's around us in a folder is nice, but what if you want to *go into* one of those folders?

In terminal, we use the `cd` command -- shorthand for *"change directory"* -- to move into and out of folders.

Suppose you ran your `ls` command and see a folder called `Documents`. If you wanted to move into that folder, you'd do the following:

1.  Type the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
cd Documents
```

2.  press `Enter/Return` to run.

Now you‚Äôre inside the `Documents` directory!

Now let's try running the `ls` command again:

1.  Type the following in your command line:

``` bash
ls
```

2.  Hit `Enter/Return` to run.

You should see a different list of files and/or folder names that you did when you ran the same command inside the home directory ‚Äî now showing the contents of your `Documents` folder.

Nice job ‚Äî you just moved between directories!

## How Can You Tell Where You Are Now? (`pwd`)

> `pwd` stands for **print working directory**.

There are a couple ways to make sure you are where you *think* you are in the Terminal.

The first is to look at the command prompt line inside your terminal window again.

You should see something like:

`Anas-MacBook-Air:Documents ana$`

In the current directory space (where there used to be a `~`), you should see the name of the name of the folder you're *currently inside*. If you followed the steps above to get into your Documents folder, for example, you should now see the name of the `Documents` folder. Remember if you're ever unsure *where* you are, terminal will tell you in the prompt!

If you're still not sure, remember you can use your new friend the `pwd` ("Print Working Directory") command from chapter 1 by typing and running:

``` bash
pwd
```

Terminal should now show something like:

`/Users/yourname/Documents`

or

`C:\Users\yourname\Documents`

## Getting out of folders (`cd ..`)

Ok now that we've moved *into* folders, what if you want to go *back out of it* to the folder you came from?

To go back up a directory:

1.  type and run the following command:

``` bash
cd ..
```

The two dots `..` simply mean "the folder above this one."

If you run the `pwd` command again, you'll see you're back to where you started!

### Quick recap on `cd` commands

Here are a few handy shortcuts you'll want to remember:

| Command         | What it does                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `cd`            | Go back to your **home** directory. |
| `cd ..`         | Move **up one** directory.          |
| `cd foldername` | Move **into** a folder.             |

### Folder names with spaces

If the folder name you're trying to access has spaces (like `My Document`s), you'll need to put it in quotes:

``` bash
cd "My Documents"
```

Or you can use a backslash to "escape" the space like:

``` bash
cd My\ Documents
```

Like we mentioned before, terminal is particular about the *way* you speak to it. For it to understand you, you've got to speak its language. But this is another reason why naming your files and directories cleanly using a naming convention like `snake_case` or `kebab-case` will help you work more efficiently.

## üìù Mini exercise

**Own your own, try this:**

1.  Open your terminal.

2.  Type and run `pwd` to see where you are.

3.  Use `ls` to list what's inside.

4.  Pick a folder you see (try something other than your `Documents` folder).

5.  `cd` into that folder.

6.  Use `pwd` again to check that you moved.

7.  `cd ..` to come back up.

Take your time. Play around.

If you get lost, remember you can just type the following command to jump back to your home directory:

``` bash
cd
```

## üî• Pro Tip: speed up with tab completion

Ok, now that you've got some practice typing things into terminal, we'll let you in on a big time-saver: when you start typing a folder name, you don't have to type the whole thing.

Hit the `Tab` key after typing part of your folder name and the terminal will *try* to **auto-complete** it for you. Now, if you've got more than one folder with similar names, you may have to add more characters till it can successfully do so. 

Let's see it action by doing the following:

1. Type out the following command, but don't run:

``` bash
cd Doc
```

2. Now, press the `Tab` key.

If there‚Äôs a `Documents` folder, terminal will fill in the rest automatically!

Huge time saver.

Remember, you'll still need to hit `Enter`/`Return` to run the command and move into the Documents folder.

## üéØ Checkpoint

In this chapter you've learned:

-   How to see what‚Äôs inside a folder (`ls`).

-   How to move into a folder (`cd foldername`).

-   How to move back up (`cd ..`).

-   How to use `Tab` to speed things up.

At this point you've started to learn some of the basics of "speaking" terminal.
